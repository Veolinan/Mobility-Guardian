# Mobility Guardian
## Overview
Mobility Guardian is IoT-based car monitoring system is designed to monitor vehicle driving behavior and provide real-time data to help detect and prevent road accidents. It utilizes various sensors and a cloud-based platform to monitor vehicle status, detect potential threats, and send alerts to both the driver and relevant authorities.
## Components
 ## Vehicle-Mounted Unit:
   IoT Sensors
 ## Cloud Platform:
   * Data storage and processing
   * Real-time alerts
   * User interface
   * Integration with external services (e.g., WhatsApp) for prompts and notifications.
## Functionality
 * Real-time speed detection: GPS module provides accurate location information of the vehicle. Our servers analyze this data to get the vehicles speed.
 * Speed detection: Data collected is analyzed alongside trained models to detect instances of over-speeding, thus detect reckless driving.
 * Driver monitoring: Cameras within the vehicle monitor the driver, the car and its environment. This may help detect driver drowsiness or similar issues that may be potential accident threats.
 * Alerts: In case of reckless driving, or other relevant issues, the system sends alerts to designated contacts.\
 * Hardware installation: Securely mount the vehicle-mounted unit in the vehicle. Connect the sensors and communication module as per the provided instructions.
 * Software configuration: Configure the cloud platform with necessary credentials and settings.
 * Pairing: Pair the vehicle-mounted unit with the cloud platform using the provided instructions.
## Future Enhancements
 * Advanced analytics: Utilize data analytics to identify patterns and predict potential issues.
 * Integration with the entire car automation system. This will come in hand to help in speed limiting in case of over-speeding.
